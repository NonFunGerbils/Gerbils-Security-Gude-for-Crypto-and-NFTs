# 3. How to protect yourself

## Passwords

**Use a password manager** - passwords are the primary line of protection of most accounts. Using a password manager is the best way to generate and keep track of long random string passwords, usernames and URLs for websites. They also make life much easier.

It is advisable to split your passwords based on threat for example use Keepass XC stored locally and offline for high importance passwords and Bitwarden browser based manager for day-to-day usage on lower importance passwords

[**KeepassXC**](https://keepassxc.org/)

* probably the most secure option
* open source
* keeps a local database that can be synced across devices if needed (Syncthing, Drive, Dropbox etc.)
* fine control over the encryption
* can use a [Yubikey](https://www.yubico.com/) as a second factor authentication or a keyfile that needs to be present along with the password, this could be any file such as a picture to not be obvious.
* not as convenient with browsers or across devices

[**Bitwarden**](https://bitwarden.com/)

* open source
* browser based
* good for syncing across devices
* can be self hosted otherwise hosted by them
* 2FA can be required for setting up on a new device

**Password strength** - the longer and more random the better which is why it is best to use a password manager to generate although some services will not support all character types and have limits to how many characters you can use

There are always passwords that will need to be memorable - the password to your password manager for example - so how should you pick a secure password?

Using your password manager to randomly generate a passphrase is a good way and then [memorising a story using the linking method](https://www.mind-expanding-techniques.net/memory-strategies-how-to-improve-your-memory/linking-method/) to tie them together. You could also come up with your own random sentence, don't use use a quote from a book or movie.

## Usernames & email addresses

Just like using unique passwords dramatically increases your security so do unique usernames. Bitwarden has a random username generator built in. In cases where email is your username you can have a catch-all address if you own your own domain with some email providers for example.

you own the domain gerbilpoo.com, you can have the email dave@gerbilpoo.com and use a catch-all of that email address such as github44312@dave.gerbilpoo.com

"github" can make it easier for you to know what service the username is for "44312" is random so that an attacker cant guess that your amazon password is amazon@dave.gerbilpoo.com.

Apple also has a service that does a similar thing with a service called [hide my email](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/iphone/iphf277f837e/15.0/ios/15.0).
