# 2. Crypto gets lost or stolen

### **Phishing links**

These can be in the form of links sent through email, discord, twitter and typically take you to a malicious website, which can either be a clone or a legitimate website which asks for information such as passwords or seed phrases or a website with malicious code that can deliver a virus to your computer / phone&#x20;

To reduce the chances of this happening to you requires mindset and following best practices

### **Data breaches**&#x20;

Data breaches happen daily, it is best to assume that any content you put on the internet through a service or site will eventually be leaked through a data breach. Leaked data can include email, usernames, passwords, address, credit card / bank details, IP address, pictures and much more, in fact anything a service has relating to you.

Password management and hygiene can help prevent this.

### **Sim swapping**&#x20;

This is porting someone's phone number to another sim card to take control of their number. Once they have this an attacker can reset the passwords to your email, from your email they can search to see which services you use and take control of those. Importantly this can mean crypto exchanges and banks.

In addition if they have access to your email they might also have access to your google drive, dropbox, icloud and be able to scrape through and take anything they like such as backups of passwords and seed phrases or personal photos

2FA (Two Factor Authentication) and OPSEC (Operational Security) can help defend against this.

### **Social engineering**&#x20;

This is a broad category that can include collecting information on someone to then impersonate them for a sim swapping attack or it could be as simple as impersonating a friend or colleague on discord and asking to send funds over.&#x20;

Social engineering is also used to befriend people and gather information about them over time. as the victim begins to trust the attacker they might divulge information such as where they live, share photos with detailed metadata, email addresses, habits, practices and other personal details that can then be used in an attack.

Here OPSEC can be used to mitigate

### Loss of seeds / passwords&#x20;

Sometimes you are your own worst enemy, relying on a single computer / phone / USB stick / piece of paper to store your passwords & seed phrases can easily result in loss.

Backups and redundancy are very important

### Sending to the wrong address

Self custodianship is a responsibility that needs to be thought through carefully. Unfortunately through mis-understanding or carelessness it can be easy to send NFTs to the wrong address. It could be someone else's wallet, a contract that is not designed to receive that asset or even the wrong blockchain.

### **Intercepted communications**&#x20;

Intercepted comms can happen through using open or public WiFi, a simple example of this can be an attacker impersonating the wifi at your local cafe, you connect to their wifi and check your email. They can then serve you a fake website and capture your login credentials.&#x20;

This is where VPNs become an important tool.
