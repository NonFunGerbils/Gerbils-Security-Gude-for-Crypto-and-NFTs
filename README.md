# 1. Introduction

Welcome to the Gerbils Security Guide for Crypto & NFTs

We are writing this guide as a resource to help the community protect themselves against loss of their digital assets. This threat comes in the form of a consistent and unrelenting army of attackers looking to exploit any vulnerability software or human. This threat also comes in the form of personal loss through incomplete backup solutions or protocol when transferring assets.

We will also take a look at secure strategies to pass on your estate in case of unexpected death or emergency.

We invite the community to get involved and add to/correct this resource where you feel you can add value or experience.
