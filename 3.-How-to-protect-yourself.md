# 3. How to protect yourself

## Passwords

**Use a password manager** - passwords are the primary line of protection of most accounts. Using a password manager is the best way to generate and keep track of long random string passwords, usernames and URLs for websites. They can also check the URL for a site is correct and they generally make life much easier.

It is advisable to split your passwords based on threat for example use Keepass XC stored locally and offline for high importance passwords and Bitwarden browser-based manager for day-to-day usage.

[**KeepassXC**](https://keepassxc.org/)

* probably the most secure option
* open source
* keeps a local database that can be synced across devices if needed (Syncthing, Drive, Dropbox etc.)
* fine control over the encryption
* can use a [Yubikey](https://www.yubico.com/) as a second factor authentication or a keyfile that needs to be present along with the password, this could be any file such as a picture to not be obvious.
* not as convenient with browsers or across devices

[**Bitwarden**](https://bitwarden.com/)

* open source
* browser based
* good for syncing across devices
* can be self hosted otherwise hosted by them
* 2FA can be required for setting up on a new device

**Password strength** 

The longer and more random the better which is why it is best to use a password manager to generate although some services will not support all character types and have limits to how many characters you can use.

**Passphrases**

There are always passwords that will need to be memorable - the password to your password manager for example - so how should you pick a secure password?

Using your password manager to randomly generate a passphrase is a good way and then [memorising a story using the linking method](https://www.mind-expanding-techniques.net/memory-strategies-how-to-improve-your-memory/linking-method/) to tie them together. You could also come up with your own random sentence but don't use song lyrics or quotes from a books / movies.

## Usernames & email addresses

Just like using unique passwords dramatically increases your security, so do unique usernames. Bitwarden has a random username generator built in. In cases where email is your username you can have a catch-all address if you own your own domain which will allow your to have a different email address for each service.

[Simplelogin](https://simplelogin.io/) I think offers one of the best services for this. You can import your own domain names make them catch-all. For example you can have the domain name **gerbilpoo.com** and accept email to **<i>coinbase1436</i>@gerbilpoo.com**, **<i>5578github</i>@gerbilpoo.com** and a unique email for every account that get forwarded on to your primary email address(s). The very unique feature of Simplelogin is you can reply to any email that gets gets forwarded to your primay email and the reply gets re-routed through a unique email and then sent from the original alias email. Making it seem like a primary email address and hiding all remnants of your primary email.

> The random numbers in **<i>coinbase1436</i>@gerbilpoo.com** is to make it unguessable in case of username and password leaks and patterns being put together for a targeted attack.

**Domain names** - It is good to use your own domain name so that if you need to change email provider/forwarder for any reason you can take your email addresses with you.

 > avoid domain names ending in .xyz as these often get routed straight into peoples spam folders by many email services. This may be true of other exotic domains but I haven't tested. I would advise sticking with older well established ones.

For low importance services such as newsletters or online purchases you can use a randomly generated alias on the simplelogin.com domains which increases privacy but reduces personal redundancy. If you don't use Simple login there are other services that offer burner aliases such as [33mail](https://33mail.com/). 

Apple also has a service that does a similar thing with a service called [hide my email](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/iphone/iphf277f837e/15.0/ios/15.0) whereby it creates randomly generated email addresses such as T$lDa9Mpp&&1E%2g6O4@icloud.com. The downside to this service means you are tied to Apple as you can't do this with a custom domain name.

## MFA (Multi Factor Authentication)

Adding 2FA to an account is on of the most effective ways of increasing the security on an account. Having a second authentication requirement makes it much more difficult for someone to gain access to an account because even if they have your username and password they will still be gated. My recommendation would be use a Yubikey where you can and Authenticator app everywhere else.

**Phone based MFA**

Should be avoided as it is vulnerable to [sim swapping attacks](1.-how-crypto-gets-lost-or-stolen.md#sim-swapping).

**Yubikey or alternative hardware authentication devices**

These offer a physical (typically USB device that you plug in to your computer and press a button to authenticate. Yubikeys are incredibly versatile, they support a wide range of standards and they can even be used to replace passwords.

>It is worth having multiple Yubikeys. when you set one up with an account set up the others too so there are spares incase you lose one. It is worth noting that sometimes you cannot register a hardware authentication device until you have setup an authenticator app.

Some Apple Macbooks with the T2 security chip can use fingerprint scanner as hardware authentication with many services. Google pixel phones can also be used as an MFA device using their [Titan M chips](https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/10/18295348/google-android-phone-fido-webauthn-phishing-two-factor-authentication).

![](<.gitbook/assets/yubikeys (1).png>)

**Authenticator apps / TOTP (time-based one time password)**

There are many of these apps you would typically have on your phone and generate a numeric passcode that changes every minute. I would recommend open source and one that allows you to export keys to a new device otherwise it becomes a nightmare when changing phones. Also good practice would be to have them set them up on multiple devices for redundancy.

Recommendations are OTP Auth (IOS), Aegis (Android), Authy (multi platform, not open source) but  most will do the job.

## Mnemonic seed management

A seed is the key to most forms of wallet and must be guarded at all costs. NEVER, NEVER put your seed into a website asking for it. Don't share it with others and dont screenshot it and upload to the cloud. Anyone who has your seed also has full control of each account associated with that seed. Here we cover some of the options for keeping your mnemonic seed phrase safe and later we will look at strategies for implementing these.

**Safe deposit boxes** 

These are a great option for keeping a safe backup of your seeds [see thread by Erick / Snowfro](https://twitter.com/ArtOnBlockchain/status/1545064027390361602?s=20&t=6e5esROGVVzVfpEES8hbvQ). It is worth considering that you don't want a person at the bank (or anyone else) to be able to access your full plain text seed. One option is to keep a spare hardware wallet (or two) in your safe deposit box, you could increase redundancy by using two different banks. Another option is to have your seed in plain text but split it between deposit boxes at different banks. Another option would be to have an encrypted USB stick (or two).

**Encrypted USB sticks / memory cards**

Storing your seedphrase in digital form is a contentious subject. Some are of the opinion that it should never be done, while others think that with caution and good practice you can build a resilient and far richer backup of your important information. For example you can include the following:

* multiple seedphrases
* password manager backups
* separate private keys
* guides and supporting documents

It is very important that you have multiple versions of an encrypted device as USB sticks and memory cards are prone to failure over time.

One of the biggest attack vectors is plugging into a computer that has been compromised. To mitigate this it is recommended that you have a completely separate offline computer that never touches the internet or better still has had its wifi and bluetooth units removed.

If you dont have free computer for this usecase you could use a bootable USB linux installer such as Ubuntu which you can boot directly into from a PC or laptop. Better yet you could use [Tails, which is a privacy focussed amnesic OS that you can also boot from a USB stick](https://tails.boum.org/).

![Tails](.gitbook/assets/tails.png)

**Paper storage (cyphered)**

[In a recent Twitter post](https://twitter.com/kaigani/status/1553435891091116032?s=20&t=6HzLqGqXUSF1FzdkQH2GDA) Kaigani laid out a wonderful method to store your seed on paper but in a ciphered way to add security. He states "You'll need:

* 64 index cards
* a way to randomize passphrases
* a way to randomize words from the dictionary

1. write 4 normal words on 4 index cards (ideally in a sequence that is meaningful to you but not obvious)
2. On the back, write each 3 of the 12 passphrase words on the 4 cards in order
3. continue to write random dictionary words on the front and 3 valid passphrase words on the back for the remaining 60 cards
4. Shuffle the cards

Picking out the right cards, in the right order should be something easy for you to do, but nearly impossible for anyone else"


## Wallets

**HD Wallets (Hierarchical Deterministic Wallets)**

These are the most common wallets in Crypto which use a mnemonic seed phrase, which is a human readable root key to generate numberous key pairs (see below for definition of key pairs) [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) is an example of a browser based HD wallet.

**Public key cryptography**

In reference to **HD Wallets** a key pair consists of a public and private key, the public key in this context acts as a public address for an account to receive crypto & tokens and the private key is used to control the account. It is a form of [public key cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography) and is the root of safety on the internet!

**Multi-signature wallets**

Muti-sig wallets can be an excellent option for certain use cases. [Gnosis Safe](https://gnosis-safe.io/) is a good product for creating single or multiple user wallets on a number of blockchains and have a top security track record. They can also be used for [recurring payments to multiple parties](https://twitter.com/niftytime/status/1415391519205298177?s=20&t=RZKI96fZ8n0GZUauqy0W0w). 

**Hardware wallets**

These are small physical devices that store your seed in a high security chip and require physical sign-off on transactions. Hardware wallets are generally recognised as the industry standard for personl seed security.

I would recommend setting up two devices with the same seed for redundancy and there are a few notes to ensure safety:

* When purchasing always buy direct from the manufacturer.
* They will NEVER come with a preinstalled seed, some attacks have come with the seed phrase already filled in. Always generate your own on the device.
* Use the official software on your computer to verify the firmware and keep the firmware updated.
* Verify the transaction you are doing on the screen of the device is correct and not just on your computer / phone.
* If anything unusual happens such as [screen turning off during a transaction](https://blog.kraken.com/post/5590/kraken-security-labs-supply-chain-attacks-against-ledger-nano-x/) don't ignore it.
* Ledger devices could be preferred to Trezor because the latter has been subject to [critical flaws in the past](https://blog.kraken.com/post/3662/kraken-identifies-critical-flaw-in-trezor-hardware-wallets/).
* It has also been suggested to use the fastest shipping possible to reduce the chance of a supply chain attack.

**Social recovery wallets**

[Argent wallet](https://www.argent.xyz/) is probably the most popular example of social recovery wallets through its IOS and Android wallets with excellent security and ease of use. You can authenticate yourself with a phone number and have email 2fa. There are many options such as self imposed limits on spend or to certain addresses without extra authentication using the guardian system.

![Argent security options example](.gitbook/assets/argent1.png)

Vitalik Buterin wrote the article [Why we need wide adoption of social recovery wallets](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/11/recovery.html) putting forth the argument for why social recovery is better than multi-sig and hardware wallets and mnemonic seed phrases

**Token approvals**

It is good practice to revoke un-necessary token approvals when they are no longer needed as over time you can leave your wallets exposed to un-necessary risk.
This can easily be done via [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/tokenapprovalchecker) or [Revoke.cash](https://revoke.cash/).

**Migrating from software wallet to hardware wallet**

If you setup a software wallet, collected hundreds or thousands of NFTs and it is prohibitively expensive to transfer your NFTs to a new hardware wallet a better option to leaving them where they are is to import that seed to a hardware wallet and remove the seed from all previous wallets.

This should only be done if it prohibitively expensive to just move the NFTs, which can otherwise be done in batches on Opensea by bundling upto 50 NFTs together. It is worth noting that although batched items transfer in one transaction the compute on the blockchain is still the same so gas will be similar to sending each one separately.


## Backups

Always make sure there are multiple instances each seephrase and infact everything important. Make sure there is no single point of failure. 

If your house burns down, will it take out all copies of your seedphrase? If so then it is not sufficiently backed up.

Scenarios to acccount for are:
* Death - if you die, will the right person(s) be able to decipher your security?
* Fire - are all copies kept in the same place?
* Theft - if your safe or the deposit box at the bank gets stolen is that the only copy?
* Data decay - [when your disks, drives and keys break or corrupt](https://www.howtogeek.com/660727/bit-rot-how-hard-drives-and-ssds-die-over-time/), will you lose everything? Keep multiple versions and have a method for checking for corruption before backing up and keep both digital and physical copies.

## VPNs (Virtual Private Networks)

VPNs are a good option to stop exposure of your home IP address to websites and services. They can also reduce some online tracking but the majority of that is done [through cookies and other means](https://www.makeuseof.com/vpn-website-tracking/).

## Phone Operating System (OS)

Your phone and the system it runs can make a big difference to security. There is too much to dive in deep here but we can provide some key points and resources:

* Stock Android on a Pixel phone will provide the best security but not privacy
* Most other Andoid providers such as Samsung will offer reduced security and privacy, through delayed security updates and an extra layer of data harvesting
* Iphone with iOS provides generally good security and privacy, both are improved dramatically by not using icloud.
* There are some custom operating systems that increase security and privacy. [GrapheneOS](https://grapheneos.org/) is de-googled with a custom hardened kernel that sandboxes each apps memory and storage. The tradeoff is usability is reduced without Google services and requires commitment to de-googling to make work. [CalyxOS](https://calyxos.org/) is degoogled android but with an open source version of google services, it doesn't have the security hardening of Graphene but does have increased privacy over stock Android.

Google offer [Google Advanced Protection](https://landing.google.com/advancedprotection/) to increase security and is recommended for Google Android users who use crypto and NFTs
Apple have a similar feature coming soon with [Apple Lockdown Mode](https://www.pocket-lint.com/phones/news/apple/161801-apple-iphone-14-launch-tipped-for-13-september).

Interestingly [The Hated One on Youtube puts forward a compelling case](https://youtu.be/Wd4Pa03LvLk) for why phones are more secure than computers contrary to popular opinion.

## Redflags

* All unexpected app, website or file behaviour
* Feeling rushed - never feel rushed to make a decision this is often used to get people to make bad decisions. Humans are easily hackable and a feeling of panic can override rationality.
* Any email, phonecall, message etc. annoyncing your wallet, account or passwords have been compromised and need urgen attention (do not click any links).
* Email domains that doesnt fully match company (website) domain eg. opensea.io vs opensea.com or openseaio.com or theopensea.io
* ALL unsolicited emails and private messages should be treated with great caution
* New online friends wanting to send you files (documents, images, video, slideshow, pitch decks). If you want to open them do it in a [virtual machine](https://www.vmware.com/topics/glossary/content/virtual-machine.html) or [Amazon Workspaces](https://clients.amazonworkspaces.com/)
* Anyone or thing asking for your seedphrase.


## OPSEC (Operational Security)

OPSEC is the process of protecting your personal and online security by maintaining good online practices and not giving out unnecessary data about yourself. It can be the practice of masking these details or even putting out dummy data. Some simple suggestions are:

* Use different email addresses for difference services with [Simplelogin](https://simplelogin.io).
* Have an alternative phone number(s) for important services
* Use encryption wherever possible
* Don't rely on a single party for everything. [Google will happily shutdown your account](https://nypost.com/2022/08/22/google-bans-dad-for-sending-pics-of-toddlers-swollen-genitals-to-doctor/) and refuse to reinstate it after it is clear there was a misunderstanding.
* Have a virtual machine or Amazon Workspace ready for any links or files that you have slight suspicion over but do want/need to open.
* Protect your home address! (this is not something you want floating around on the Internet)
* Protect your real name. This doesnt apply to everyone but it is advisable to go by an alias online unless absolutely necessary.
* In extreme cases you may wish to setup a forwarding address or PO BOX for mail and own assets such as your house and car under a company name.

## Actions to take now

* If you don't have a password manager - get one NOW
* Audit your passwords, replace any reused ones.
* Revoke token Approvals
* Refresh / create backups
* Write a guide for your next of kin
* Make and execute a strategy to pass on your digital assets.
* Develop a security mindset, keep in mind and asess your behaviours and habits and think about the way they might expose you to harm online.
